# NodeJS Discord Bot Using the new OpenAI Assistants API

In this repo we integrate Discord.js with the new OpenAI Assistants API. The bot operates within Discord channels, listening to messages and using OpenAI to generate responses.

## Features

- **Discord Integration**: The bot listens to messages in Discord channels.
- **OpenAI Response Generation**: Leverages the new OpenAI Assistants API to create responses to messages.
- **Message Thread Tracking**: Maintains message threads for continuity in conversations.
- **NEW Assistants Capabilities**: Since the bot uses Assistants, you no longer have to worry about context management and you can also benefit from assistant capabilities such as `code interpreter` and knowledge `retrieval`

- A Discord bot token (from Discord Developer Portal).
- An OpenAI API key.
